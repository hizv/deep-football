"""Goal-aware potential-based reward shaping for soccer_twos.

Design principle: the only form of state-dependent reward shaping that is
guaranteed to preserve the optimal policy of the original MDP is
potential-based shaping (Ng, Harada, Russell 1999):

    F(s, s') = gamma * Phi(s') - Phi(s)

We therefore put every continuous shaping signal inside a single scalar
potential Phi, then let the PBRS telescoping structure induce the per-step
reward. Only genuinely event-like signals (a discrete kick) are added outside
the potential.

Potential (per agent i, derived only from that agent's raw 42x8 ray cast):

    Phi_i(s) = -alpha * d_ball(i)  -  beta * d_opp_goal(i)

  - d_ball(i)     : agent-i's min ray-distance to the ball (1.0 when unseen)
  - d_opp_goal(i) : agent-i's min ray-distance to the opposing goal
  - alpha dominates (default 1.0). beta is smaller (default 0.3) — enough to
    encourage upfield positioning without overriding ball pursuit.

Why couple to the opponent goal? A ball-only potential pulls both team-mates
to the ball. Adding -beta * d_opp_goal gives the off-ball agent a gradient
toward the opponent's half, implicitly producing spread (no ad-hoc threshold
needed) and creating passing lanes.

Event term: kick_bonus(i).  PBRS on Phi = -d_ball has an unwanted side
effect — when an agent kicks the ball, d_ball jumps up, so Phi drops, so
gamma*Phi(s') - Phi(s) is negative. Without a counter-signal the agent is
trained to stay glued to the ball and never kick it away. The kick_bonus is a
small direct reward gated on a genuine kick event (agent was touching the
ball, ball is now away):

    kick_bonus(i) = base + extra * max(0, 1 - d_opp_goal(i))

The extra term makes the bonus direction-aware: a kick taken near the
opponent goal (a probable shot) is worth more than one taken near the agent's
own half (a clearance). This exploits information available from the rays
(seeing the opponent goal) without needing ball-velocity geometry.
